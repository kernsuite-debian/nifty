Description: Numerical Information Field Theory (Python 3)
 NIFTy, "Numerical Information Field Theory", is
 a versatile library designed to enable the development of signal
 inference algorithms that operate regardless of the underlying grids
 (spatial, spectral, temporal, â€¦) and their resolutions.
 Its object-oriented framework is written in Python, although it accesses
 libraries written in C++ and C for efficiency.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
